# Unity 2D Demo - A New Adventure
The game I submitted as my end-term project for the Unity 2D module at Green IT Academy, with a lot of updates since then.

**Assets**, **Packages** and **ProjectSettings** folders are for Unity. **DEMO_A_New_Adventure** folder is for quick play without the need to load Unity.
