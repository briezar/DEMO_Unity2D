# Unity 2D Project
The game I submitted as my end-term project for the Unity 2D module at Green IT Academy.

**Assets**, **Packages** and **ProjectSettings** folders are for Unity. **Unity2D-Project-exe** folder is for quick play without the need to load Unity.

*Get out of the house, talk to the NPC then go north. The bush near the NPC has no enemies, the bush near the dog has enemies.*

## ðŸ•¹ Controls:
- **WASD** for movement and choosing options
- **Enter** for interact (talk), select option
- **Esc** for exit

## ðŸŽ® Features:
- Controlled Random encounter
- Battle system, AI
- Dialogue system

## ðŸ›‘ *Development process stopped at finishing befriending the dog*
